SQL scripts used in Database Systems Lab, Assignment 2

Made in MySQL and intended to be run only with MySQL. Using the Workbench, execute these scripts in the following order:

    + setup
    + triggers
    + procedures
    + views
    + sample_db
    + test (not really a script, it's there to test various statements after setting up everything)
    
Made any changes to the 5 setup scripts? Just run them again in the same order.

New queries implemented per the PDF's instruction is separated into its own script for easy viewing. Those queries are already included in the other modules.
