# EbookSQL
SQL scripts used in Database Systems Lab, Assignment 2

Made in MySQL and intended to be run only with MySQL. Using the Workbench, execute these scripts in the following order:

    + setup
    + triggers
    + procedures
    + views
    + sample_db
    + test (not really a script, it's there to test various statements after setting up everything)
    
Made any changes to the 5 setup scripts? Just run them again in the same order.

New queries implemented per the PDF's instruction are placed into a separate script (ebook_pdf_queries.sql) for easy viewing. Other scripts already include these by default.
