# EbookSQL
SQL scripts used in Database Systems Lab, Assignment 1 + 2

Made in MySQL and intended to be run only with MySQL. Using the Workbench, execute these scripts in the following order:

    + setup
    + triggers
    + procedures
    + views
    + sample_db
    + test (not necessarily a script, it's there to act as the console when testing to keep other files clean)
    
Should any changes are made to the 5 scripts, run them again in the same order to reflect the new changes.

New queries implemented per the PDF's instruction are placed into a separate script (ebook_pdf_queries.sql) for easy viewing. Other scripts already include these by default.
